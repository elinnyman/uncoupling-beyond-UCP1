# uncoupling-beyond-UCP1

The files here can be used to simulate the models for the tested hypotheses (H1-H3) in the paper "Systems biology reveals uncoupling beyond UCP1 in human white fat-derived beige adipocytes"

Download all files and open the file main.m in Matlab. In this file you can decide which model to simulate (model_H1.txt, model_H2.txt or model_H3.txt). To simulate the selected model, run the file main.m (the default model is model_h3.txt)

Note: The MatLab toolbox IQM Tools Pro SB (IntiQuan; http://www.intiquan.com) is needed to run the scripts.
